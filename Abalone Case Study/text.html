Abalone Case Study
Problem Statement:
The age of abalone is determined by cutting the shell through the cone, staining it, and counting the number of rings through a microscope -- a boring and time-consuming task. Other measurements, which are easier to obtain, are used to predict the age. Further information, such as weather patterns and location (hence food availability) may be required to solve the problem.

Attribute Information

Given is the attribute name, attribute type, the measurement unit and a brief description. The number of rings is the value to predict. 

Name / Data Type / Measurement Unit / Description
-----------------------------
Sex / nominal / -- / M, F, and I (infant)
Length / continuous / mm / Longest shell measurement
Diameter / continuous / mm / perpendicular to length
Height / continuous / mm / with meat in shell
Whole weight / continuous / grams / whole abalone
Shucked weight / continuous / grams / weight of meat
Viscera weight / continuous / grams / gut weight (after bleeding)
Shell weight / continuous / grams / after being dried
Rings / integer / -- / +1.5 gives the age in years. 

You have to predict the rings of each abalone which will lead us to the age of that abalone.
